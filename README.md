# vessel-deployment-tool



The Vessel Deployment and Voyage Simulation Tool is a decision-support platform designed for chartering managers and fleet operators in the LNG shipping industry. The tool calculates vessel-specific breakeven costs, factoring fuel prices, carbon emissions (EU ETS), and compliance penalties (FuelEU Maritime), to optimize fleet deployment strategies between spot market and time charters. It includes scenario analysis capabilities for assessing market tightness and sensitivity to external variables, enabling proactive risk management. The tool's future scope involves integrating machine learning techniques for accurate freight rate forecasting, further enhancing strategic decision-making capabilities and competitive positioning. Ultimately, it drives increased profitability and operational sustainability for ship operators.

It can be applied to any shipping sector - Tanker shipping, Dry bulk shipping, Gas shipping, etc. if the specific market data is available. 

The Scope of this project is limited to LNG shipping industry.




VALUE PROPOSITION

The Vessel Deployment & Voyage Simulation Tool helps shipping companies make smarter, data-driven decisions about fleet management and vessel chartering, directly increasing profitability and reducing risk. By precisely calculating daily vessel operating costs (including fuel, carbon charges, and regulatory penalties), it identifies the most profitable deployment strategy (Spot vs. TC), thus ensuring optimal use of each vessel.

Its scenario-based approach allows chartering teams to quickly assess how changes in fuel prices, freight rates, and market conditions impact financial outcomes. By clearly visualizing market and chartering sensitivities, the tool enables proactive risk management strategies—including FFA hedging—helping companies mitigate volatility in freight rates and regulatory environments.

In the future, by incorporating machine-learning-driven freight-rate predictions, the tool will offer powerful forecasting capabilities, further enhancing strategic planning and competitiveness.

In short, the tool turns complex market, operational, and regulatory data into clear, actionable insights, enabling LNG operators to maximize profit, manage risk effectively, and navigate increasingly stringent environmental regulations with confidence.




TAXI BUSINESS ANALOGY

Imagine you run a taxi company with 10 taxis. Each taxi has different fuel efficiency, different fuel costs, and some taxis need more repairs than others. Sometimes, there are rules about pollution or penalties if your taxis aren't eco-friendly.

Now, suppose customers pay different prices for taxi rides each day. On some days, lots of people need taxis, so fares are high. On other days, fewer people want rides, and fares drop.

Your job is to decide which taxis should work on short trips (like picking up customers on the street), which taxis should wait for longer, pre-arranged rides, and which ones should stay parked to save money.

This is exactly what the LNG Vessel Simulation Tool does—but for big ships instead of taxis. The tool tells you how much money each ship needs to break even (covering fuel costs, pollution penalties, and other expenses). Then it checks what customers will pay that day (the “spot” rate) or in future long-term deals (the “time charter” rate).

If today's fare is higher than the taxi's breakeven cost, you'd send it out right away to earn money immediately. But if today's fares are low, you'd either look for a long-term deal at a steady fare or keep the taxi parked until fares rise again.

Just as you might predict when more customers need taxis (like during busy holiday weekends or big events), your tool in the future could use smart technology called machine learning to predict shipping rates ahead of time, letting ship managers plan better.




10MIN ELEVATOR PITCH

Imagine you're managing a fleet of ships—tankers, bulk carriers, or container ships. Each day, you face tough decisions: which ships should you deploy right away, which should wait, and how to respond to changes in fuel prices, freight rates, or environmental rules?

That's where the Fleet Deployment Simulator comes in. It helps shipping companies easily calculate how much it costs to run each ship daily, including fuel, carbon costs, and regulatory fees. Then, it quickly compares these costs to current market rates—telling you instantly if you should accept short-term spot jobs, sign long-term charters, or even keep a ship idle until the market improves.

The simulator also evaluates voyages individually, recommending the best ship for each trip to maximize your profit. It lets you see clearly how market changes impact your fleet and allows you to test various scenarios to stay prepared.

And soon, we'll add advanced machine learning to accurately predict future freight rates, giving you the advantage of knowing when to lock in profitable voyages or protect your company against market downturns.

In short, this tool simplifies complex shipping decisions, helping you save money, manage risk, and boost your company's profitability in a competitive and changing market."**
