Dashboard 1 – 
a.	Demand/Supply dynamics - Equilibrium calculator – Excess/surplus demand or supply
 
b.	Market data can be used for - LNG, Bulk, Tanker shipping segment
We start with LNG.

Deployment simulation - TC or Spot market? The most profitable market
Dynamic Data Table for – 
-	Vessel-specific daily costs (fuel, carbon, margin, FuelEU penalty)
-	Breakeven Spot rates
-	Spot vs. Time Charter recommendations
-	Total daily CO₂ emissions per vessel


Dashboard 2 – 

a. Vessel details
-	Input vessel particulars – Length, Beam, Draft, DWT, Draft
-	Performance details - speed and consumption values and curves
-	Performance curves comparison feature
-	Generators consumption

b. Voyage Simulation and Optimal speed calculator for each vessel
-	Input for fuel price, freight market rate, voyage days, distance
-	Calculate the optimal speed in each vessel section using the inputs
-	Voyage simulation data table for Total voyage costs (including FuelEU penalties, fuel, carbon, margin), Freight revenue and profitability per vessel
